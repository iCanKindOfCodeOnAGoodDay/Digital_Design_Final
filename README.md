This is the Final Project from the Digital Design class that I just finished at San Francisco State University

I really enjoyed making this project. The final result is not what I was originally planning, but I'm quite satisfied with the results. I did my best to implement people's feedback, and I went where that took me. It was important to me to keep this project as grunge and punk rock as possible. When I started with the moodboard, for whatever reason I just started to make a collage. The original plan was to remake the Nevermind album, you know, the one with the naked baby. But I went a different route. I had no idea what I wanted to do for the world tour poster. But I figured that the collage would be pretty cool to implement into the poster, so I just put it up there basically as a starting point, but then I decided that I like it.

Professor gave me the idea to basically not re-design the naked baby album, but to create a new album using my collage as the background. I think it turned into a really cool concept and tribute to Kurt and to Nirvana.

I am turning this in a couple of days early, so there's not really too much else that I would do if I had time, I think that I've implemented my ideas fully at this point. I guess if this was a professional setting, at this point I might try out another concept and re-run the process from the gate. Perhaps I could play with my fonts, and try to find other fonts that might look better. Perhaps I would make the album name much smaller. Anyways. Thanks for a great class everybody! And to the Professor, I appreciate all the new stuff that I've learned in this class. Right on.
